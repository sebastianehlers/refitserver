# RefitServer
Simplify client-server communication with type-safe controllers with autogenerated path and attribute alignment based on Refit service interfaces using RefitServer for ASP.NET Core in .NET.

Behind the scenes this is using Source generation to generate partial classes, supporting method and parameter attributes.

## TODO
As this is a work in progress a nuget package does not yet exists. It is on the way :)

## Getting started
### Project setup
When using RefitServer the ideal structure is to have 3 projects:
- Client
- Server
- Contract

Contract should be referenced by the Client and Server project. The Contract project contains the interface services and descriptions marked up using Refit, along with DTOs used between the client and the server.

See 'samples' in this repo.
### Server Controllers
When creating your controllers, you need to inherit Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Controller and your Refit interface.
Your controllers must be partials and have the following attribute on the class [GenerateRefitController].

## What is supported:
- Http methods
- Paths
- Route parameters
- Query parameters
- Body parameters
